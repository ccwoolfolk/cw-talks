# The Visual Display of Quantitative Information

## Edward Tufte

- Born in KC in 1942
- Statistics and political science background
- Developed materials for journalists displaying statistical graphics
- Formalized a system of quality re: graphical display

## Personal relevance

## Tenets

- In a single phrase, graphical integrity
  - Treat your readers like intelligent, mature adults
    - Worthwhile, interesting data
    - High information density
  - Show the data
    - Axis placement
  - Be explicit about the comparisons you are inviting the reader to make (and make them in good faith)
  - Don't reinforce systematic biases in human perception
    - Pie charts
- Integrated graphics -- graphs, text, maps, annotations
- Visualizations should be beautiful
  - Not the same as "visualizations should be embellished"
  - Like all good art, should have a message worth communicating
- [Another take](https://moz.com/blog/data-visualization-principles-lessons-from-tufte)

## A few measures

- Lie factor
- Data ink ratio
- Data density of a display
